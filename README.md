<br><br><br>
The Shopping Cart System (SCS) is a software that makes it possible for customers to select products and but them online.  
In an archaic environment, a customer could browse, grab a product off the shelf, and head to the checkout counter to make a purchase. Or they could use a cart around the store to gather multiple products.<br><br>
Our goal is to design a system which ensures streamlined use and optimum customer satisfaction. This project/application will aim to mimic some of the mainstream online shopping sites, which majority of the population uses while maintaining a simplistic model with functions relevant to our current project.  
The application will contain major features like products browsing, cart management, automatic bill production, price calculation and etc. It will consist of many pages, one such page is the Inventory page shown below:

## Conclusion
The objective of this project was to create a new shopping process concept for the groceries and other items, with the aim to simplify the whole shopping process for customers by using a computerized shopping cart.  

Smart shopping cart system was developed from the perspective of customer whose needs were not fully fulfilled once he takes part of the shopping system process.  

Research shows that service innovation can be a key differentiator and driver for competitiveness in the future. Therefore, by using this new innovative system all part of shopping process will be winners: Customers will reduce wait time, simplify the shopping process, knowing what and where to buy it, making their shopping process more pleasant and manageable.  

For stores: They can increase sales (both in terms of immediate impulse buys and future customer loyalty) by producing happier customers. Additionally, it will increase their staff productivity (thus decreasing their costs) by efficiently matching staff members to customers.   
Furthermore, it gives them management data about their customers and their processes, which can lead to ongoing competitive advantages.
